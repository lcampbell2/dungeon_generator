Elven Tic Tac Toe,Different enough from our version that there's a manual,Defeat the ancient elven ghost in this game you've never played before,14,2
Bobbing for Giant's Toes,"Gross, but self descriptive",Better than dying in a dungeon,15,6
Giant Chess,Pieces are the size of you!,"Same thing, but a total pain to push around",9,1
Musical Chairs,A ring of 12 chairs are in front of a door with sheet music etched into it. Each chairs echoes a different tone throughout the chamber.,Playing the piece of music with the chairs unlocks the way forward,19,8
Which Key?,"There's a door with a large, unusual keyhole. The room is filled with keys and a handful of random objects. All the keys but the proper one are coated in poison",The correct key is a wine bottle strewn amongst the room,7,7
Electric Feel,Two electrified handles are attached to opposite sides of a 30-foot chamber.,The characters need to form a conductive link to power the door and get it to open.,12,4
Mirror Image,"There is a mirror on the wall and anyone who looks in it sees a version of themselves, only with a sneaky, mischievous smile on their face. The mirror image is also holding a small statue of a triceratops. The mirror is keyed to a door, chest, or some other item that needs to be opened. Somewhere hidden in the room is an identical statue of the triceratops.","If someone finds the statue and stands in front of the mirror and holds the statue in the same position as their reflection in the mirror, the item the mirror is keyed to opens.",2,3
Root of the Problem,"There is a tree grown and twisted that looks oddly like a warrior holding a spear. The spear tip is pointing to a certain point on the ground where archaeological tools, including several shovels, are stabbed into the ground. Buried six feet under the ground at that spot is a chest containing a golden statue of an octopus of great value. The octopus statue holds shovels in each tentacle. Carved into the tree are the words “hang in there.” (This hint is a red herring.) Further along in the adventure the party will encounter golden tentacles covering a door and blocking the way forward. In the middle of the tentacles is a depression in which the golden octopus statue fits.",Placing the statue there causes the tentacles to retract and open the way forward.,10,5
Long Distance Statues,"In two different places in the Dungeon there should a room of statues, and another room with a door covered in symbols. The statues should correlate to the symbols, and they must be aligned in the statue room to match the design the door displays.","Move the statues in one room to the appropriate spots, and it will unlock the other room's door.",8,10
The Count Down,"The players stand in a room, furnished with thematic objects of the DMs choice, the more well described the better. Symbols are spread across the head of the door in front of them, there are anywhere between 10-30 symbols. In the center of the room, there is a pedestal with some form of switch.","The players will activate the switch, and the room will begin to do something ominous as the symbols on the door begin to glow one per second. These symbols are like a countdown as they reach the end of the 10-30 symbols, the door will just open. Nothing happens, it just opens, the trick is to make the players believe something will happen.",7,9
